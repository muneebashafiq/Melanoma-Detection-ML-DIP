**Automatic Melanoma Detection using DIP and ML Techniques**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on the automatic detection of melanoma using Digital Image Processing (DIP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The goal is to classify skin lesions as melanoma or benign by leveraging various ML models and evaluating their performance.

**Dataset**

The dataset consists of labeled skin lesion images.
Preprocessing steps include image resizing, enhancement, and feature extraction.
Machine Learning Models Used
The following ML models were trained and evaluated:
âœ… Support Vector Machines (SVM)
âœ… Logistic Regression
âœ… k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
âœ… Decision Trees

**Performance Metrics**
The models were evaluated using standard classification metrics, and the results are summarized in the table below:

**Key Findings**
ðŸ“Œ SVM performed the best, achieving the highest AUC (0.97), accuracy (0.90), and recall (0.88), making it the most effective model for melanoma detection.
ðŸ“Œ Logistic Regression had lower AUC (0.83) but showed competitive accuracy.
ðŸ“Œ k-NN and Decision Trees performed similarly in terms of accuracy but lacked an AUC value in this evaluation.

**Conclusion**
The results indicate that SVM is the most suitable model for melanoma detection in this project. Future improvements may include deep learning approaches (CNNs) and hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
